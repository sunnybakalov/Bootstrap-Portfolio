                            <p>My name is Staniel Bakalov. I was born and raised in Sliven, Bulgaria. I came to the
                                United States when I was 10 years old. I've called Utah my home for the past 16 years.
                                I lived in Sandy for 12 years and have lived in Bluffdale for the last 4 years. My wife
                                and I have a 2 year old boy and are expecting another baby in April 2019!</p>
                            <p>My hobbies include: working out, hiking, photography, cars, and shooting. I enjoy
                                watching The Office, drawing, editing photos, and watching Disney/Pixar movies with my
                                son when I am not doing something active. Some of our favorite Disney/Pixar movies are:
                                Coco, Zootopia, and the Despicable Me series. You can find any genre of music on my
                                Spotify. My favorite music is hip hop and my favorite artist is Mac Miller. </p>

                        <p>I am currently employed at Podium as an account development manager. I love the company that
                            I work for, but my goal is to get out of sales and elevate my career. I am aiming for the
                            top and want to be a software engineer for our company. I feel very passionate about the
                            software that Podium offers and I have really enjoyed being a part of the awesome culture
                            here.</p>

                        <p>I would love to continue working here for a long time. Never did I think I could find a
                            workplace that is truly invested in my happiness and into developming my career. I hope
                            that the bootcamp will help me with the necessary tools to succeed in my company.</p>
